This game is under development, feel free to take a look. Working on fixing the PlayerSteering method which is abit messy atm. 

Runs okay right now though.

The gamepads we are using ( cool [+..••] NES-replicas ) don't map correctly in monogame, so we might fork this project for correct gamepad mapping and keyboard version.
